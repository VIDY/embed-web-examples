<div align="center">The JavaScript SDK for Vidy Embeds</div>





## TODO : ADD images, FINISH MASTER THE DASHBOARD, UPDATE install section



## Usage
To Use the Vidy SDK to embed Vidys onto a page, There are 3 main steps:
#### 1. Register with Vidy and Create a Dashboard Account
* This can be achieved at <a href = 'https://dashboard.vidy.com/register'>Register</a>
* Once registered, you should be taken to your new dashboard
	*  <a href = "https://dashboard.vidy.com/">Dashboard Link 			for convenience</a>
*  Create a new Application (APP) and give it a name. 
* INSERT APP_CREATION.PNG here
* Take note of the **APP_ID** that is created, however they can always be found on the settings section under ```APPLICATIONS``` 
	 * <a href="https://dashboard.vidy.com/settings/applications">Settings/applications link for convenience</a>
* Visit [Application ID](#Understanding\ the\ Application\ ID) for the importance of the Application and the APP_ID
#### 2. Install the Vidy Embed onto your page.
* There are many ways to do this. Visit [Install Vidy Embed](#INSTALL) for installion steps
* **FILL THIS OUT** 

#### 3. Embed Vidys onto a Page
#####  This works much better with the Vidy Dashboard Electron APP Download link --> <a href="https://vidy-app.s3.amazonaws.com/production/latest/Vidy-0.2.11-mac.zip">Vidy Dashboard Download [MAC ONLY]<a>
1. **Upload your video clips**. 
	1. visit the upload section of your dashboard and upload your videos. 
		* This can be found under the Upload section of the Electron app or <a href="https://dashboard.vidy.com/upload/info">Upload Section</a> if on the web. 
		* Upload your Video, Enter the title, tags, and subtitle information for the video. These will be used to search for them at embed time. 
		* UPLOAD PNG HERE
2. **Embed your videos**
	1. Visit the ```Preview``` section of the your dashboard 
	   * <a href="https://dashboard.vidy.com/preview">Preview Section Link for convenience</a>
	2. Enter your page URL at the top. You should see your page appear in the center.
	3. Highlight the text on your page you wish to embed
	4. The search section (on the left) will be immediately populated with the highlighted text.
		* Change the search to find the uploaded video you wish to embed.
	5. Once You found the video, hit the ```+``` on the right corner and your video is now embeded.
		* Your highlighted text should know be highlighted pink to signify it is now an embeded text and your a list of all your embeds on the current page will be on the right. 
3. **Publish your embeded clips as Vidys live on the web**. 
	1. If your preview is the way you want it, hit ```PUBLISH``` on the right corner of the preview section tab and your DONE 	
	2. Your clips have been successfully embeded as Vidys on your page and they are live on the web! To view them live, simply navigate to your page on any broswer and watch your Vidys spice up your page and watch your traffic interact with your vidys!




### Mastering the Dashboard
	






### Understanding the Application ID and POSTID 
## Install

```
$ npm install --save @vidy/embed
```

Then with a module bundler like [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) or [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), use as you would anything else:

```js
// using ES6 modules
import Vidy from '@vidy/embed';

// using CommonJS modules
const Vidy = require('@vidy/embed');
```

You may also use the [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) build within a `<script>` tag if you'd prefer:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@vidy/embed/dist/embed.min.js"></script>
```

> This registers the `Vidy` constructor globally.


## Usage

:bulb: Looking for examples? [We got you covered](https://github.com/VIDY/embed-web-examples)!

***Basic Setup***

_This assumes text content exists at time of instantiation._

```js
import Vidy from '@vidy/embed';

let vidy = new Vidy({
  appid: '2199e8c8-abcd-efgh-a123-d463129790c5',
  postid: location.pathname, //=> eg "hello-world"
  content: '#article',
  autoload: true
});
```

***Dynamic Setup &mdash; AKA, no autoload***

_When text is rendered dynamically / after script execution._

```js
import Vidy from '@vidy/embed';

let selector = '#article';
let div = document.querySelector(selector);
let pathname = location.pathname; //=> eg "hello-world"

let vidy = new Vidy({
  appid: '2199e8c8-abcd-efgh-a123-d463129790c5',
  postid: pathname,
  content: selector
});

// Query our own Blog API for JSON
fetch(`/api/posts/${pathname}`).then(r => r.json()).then(data => {
  // Add text to the container we care about!
  div.innerHTML = data.html;
  // Manually call load()
  vidy.load();
});
```

## API

### Vidy(options)

Returns: `Vidy`

Returns the `Vidy` instance.

#### options.appid

Type: `String`<br>
Required: `true`

The Application identifier.

> You may create a new Vidy Application for free [here](#todo)! :tada:

#### options.postid

Type: `String|Number`<br>
Required: `true`

The unique identifier for any given page.

Most web frameworks have built-in helpers to generate & ensure unique page identifiers; see [some examples](https://github.com/VIDY/embed-web-examples) for help. You may also resort to using the `location.pathname`, if necessary.

> **Important:** This should be immutable; each `postid` yields its own specific list of Vidy Embeds!

#### options.content

Type: `String`<br>
Default: `'body'`

The selector of the parent container that wraps the text content Vidy should traverse.

For example, given the following markup:

```html
<body>
  <div id="app">
    <header id="top">
      <nav>...</nav>
    </header>
    <div class="wrapper">
      <main id="content">
        <article>
          <!-- content lives here -->
        </article>
        <div id="comments">...</div>
      </main>
      <aside id="sidebar">
        <div id="trending-posts">...</div>
        <div id="related-posts">...</div>
      </aside>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
```

By default, the Vidy SDK will grab ***all text*** on the page, including comments, related & trending post widgets, etc. You _probably_ don't want the SDK placing links in these areas.

Instead, you could pass `content: '#content'`, targeting the article _and_ the comments' text; or you can narrow link placements within the article exclusively via the `'#content > article'` selector.

#### options.autoload

Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Whether or not the SDK should immediately draw link around text phrases.

If the text within [`options.content`](#optionscontent) is loaded dynamically (eg, via an API or a headless CMS), then `autoload` should retain the `false` default.

> **Important:** This should _only_ be `true` if your content is included in the server response!


### init(postid)

The method that appends the SDK elements to the page, if they don't already exist. It also queries the Vidy API for the list of Embeds (both social & advertising) that belong to the given `postid`.

If no `postid` is received, the SDK uses the value provided on instantiation &mdash; see [`options.postid`](#optionspostid) for more.

You should only need to invoke this method after successfully navigating to a new page on a client-side application.

> **Note:** This is always called automatically when creating a new `Vidy` instance.

### load()

The method that draws Vidy links around their relevant phrases.

At this point, the SDK expects and traverses text content within the [`options.content`](#optionscontent) container.

> **Note:** This is called automatically when [`options.autoload`](#optionsautoload) is true.


## Browser Support

The JavaScript SDK relies on [`fetch`](https://caniuse.com/#search=fetch) and [`Promise`](https://caniuse.com/#search=promise) support, which yields these minimum browsers:

* Edge 14+
* Firefox 40+
* Chrome 42+
* Safari 10.1+
* iOS 10.3+

The SDK will automatically download polyfills for `fetch` and `Promise` if it does not detect these globals.

> **Note:** To use the polyfills you already provide, ensure that `window.fetch` and `window.Promise` are defined.
